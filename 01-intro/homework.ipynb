      "    *   1 large onion, finely chopped\n",

      "    *   1 tablespoon sugar (or honey)\n",
      "    *   1 teaspoon kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves), crushed\n",

      "\n",
      "**Part 1: Marinating and Cooking the Chicken Tikka**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Marinate the Chicken:** In a large bowl, combine all the marinade ingredients (yogurt, lemon juice, ginger-garlic paste, garam masala, cumin, turmeric, chili powder, cayenne pepper (if using), salt, and pepper).  Add the chicken pieces and mix well, ensuring all pieces are coated.  Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.  Longer marinating (up to 4-6 hours or overnight) is ideal for better flavor and tenderizing.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Cook the Chicken:**\n",
      "    *   **Oven Method (Recommended):** Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or foil.  Arrange the marinated chicken in a single layer on the baking sheet.  Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and slightly charred on the edges.\n",
      "    *   **Grill Method:** Preheat grill to medium-high heat. Thread the marinated chicken onto skewers (optional, but easier to handle). Grill for about 10-15 minutes, turning occasionally, until cooked through and slightly charred.\n",
      "    *   **Pan-Fry Method:** Heat a tablespoon of oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the marinated chicken in batches (don't overcrowd the pan).  Cook for about 8-10 minutes, turning occasionally, until cooked through and lightly browned.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Part 2: Making the Tikka Masala Sauce**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Sauté Aromatics:** In a large skillet or pot, heat the oil or ghee over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook until softened and golden brown, about 5-7 minutes.  Add the chopped bell pepper (if using) and cook for another 3-5 minutes.\n",
      "2.  **Add Spices:** Add the ginger-garlic paste and cook for 1 minute, until fragrant.  Add the garam masala, cumin, turmeric, and chili powder.  Cook for another minute, stirring constantly, until the spices are fragrant.\n",
      "3.  **Add Tomatoes and Simmer:** Pour in the crushed tomatoes, coconut milk (or heavy cream), and chicken broth (or water).  Add the sugar (or honey). Bring the sauce to a simmer, then reduce heat to low and simmer for 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce has thickened slightly.\n",
      "4.  **Add Chicken and Finish:** Add the cooked chicken tikka pieces to the sauce. Stir to coat the chicken.  Simmer for another 5-10 minutes, allowing the chicken to absorb the flavors of the sauce.  Stir in the crushed kasuri methi.\n",
      "5.  **Season and Serve:** Taste the sauce and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper as needed. Garnish with fresh cilantro. Serve hot with basmati rice or naan bread.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Tips and Variations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Marinating Time:**  The longer you marinate the chicken, the more flavorful and tender it will be. Aim for at least 30 minutes, but overnight is best.\n",
      "*   **Yogurt:** Full-fat yogurt will give a richer flavor, but low-fat works too. Greek yogurt will make the marinade thicker.\n",
      "*   **Spice Level:** Adjust the amount of chili powder and cayenne pepper to your preferred level of spiciness.\n",
      "*   **Creaminess:**  For an even creamier sauce, add a tablespoon or two of butter or ghee at the end.\n",
      "*   **Tomatoes:**  You can use fresh tomatoes (peeled and chopped) instead of canned crushed tomatoes.  You'll need about 2 pounds. Simmer for a longer time to reduce the liquid.\n",
      "*   **Vegetables:**  Feel free to add other vegetables to the sauce, such as peas, cauliflower, or spinach.\n",
      "*   **Smoked Paprika:** A pinch of smoked paprika can add a nice smoky flavor.\n",
      "*   **Lemon/Lime Juice:** A squeeze of lemon or lime juice at the end can brighten the flavors.\n",
      "*    **Make it Vegan:** Replace the chicken with chickpeas or paneer.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Important Considerations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Don't Overcook the Chicken:** Overcooked chicken will be dry.  Use a meat thermometer to ensure the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C).\n",
      "*   **Simmering the Sauce:** Simmering the sauce allows the flavors to meld together and the sauce to thicken.  Don't rush this step.\n",
      "*   **Kasuri Methi:**  Kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves) adds a characteristic flavor to tikka masala. Don't skip it if you can find it. You can find this at your local Indian grocery store.\n",
      "*   **Salt:** Be mindful of the salt content. Taste and adjust as needed, especially after adding the tomatoes.\n",
      "*   **Freshness:** Use fresh spices for the best flavor.\n",
      "\n",
