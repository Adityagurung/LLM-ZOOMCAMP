      "\n",
      "*   2 lbs boneless, skinless chicken thighs or breasts, cut into 1-inch cubes\n",
      "*   1 cup plain yogurt (full-fat is best, Greek yogurt works too, but may need a little milk added to thin)\n",
      "*   2 tablespoons lemon juice\n",
      "*   2 tablespoons ginger-garlic paste (equal parts ginger and garlic, finely minced or blended)\n",
      "*   1 tablespoon garam masala\n",

      "*   2 tablespoons vegetable oil or ghee\n",
      "*   1 large onion, finely chopped\n",
      "*   1 green bell pepper, finely chopped (optional, but adds flavor and color)\n",

      "*   1 teaspoon sugar (or honey, to balance acidity)\n",
      "*   Salt to taste\n",
      "*   Fresh cilantro leaves, chopped, for garnish\n",
      "\n",
      "**Equipment:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   Large bowl\n",
      "*   Baking sheet or grill\n",
      "*   Large skillet or pot\n",
      "*   Measuring cups and spoons\n",
      "\n",
      "**Instructions**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Get Started:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Prepare the Chicken:** Cut the chicken into 1-inch cubes and place it in a large bowl.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Marinate the Chicken:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Combine Marinade Ingredients:** In the bowl with the chicken, add the yogurt, lemon juice, ginger-garlic paste, garam masala, cumin, coriander, turmeric, chili powder, salt, and pepper.\n",
      "2.  **Mix and Marinate:** Mix well to ensure the chicken is evenly coated. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or preferably overnight (up to 24 hours).  The longer it marinates, the more flavorful and tender the chicken will be.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Cook the Chicken (Tikka):**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Preheat:** Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C). Alternatively, you can grill the chicken.\n",
      "2.  **Arrange Chicken:** Thread the chicken onto skewers or spread it out in a single layer on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.\n",
      "3.  **Bake or Grill:**\n",
      "    *   **Oven:** Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and lightly charred in some spots.\n",
      "    *   **Grill:** Grill over medium-high heat for about 10-15 minutes, turning occasionally, until cooked through and lightly charred.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Prepare the Tikka Masala Sauce:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Sauté Aromatics:** In a large skillet or pot, heat the oil or ghee over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and bell pepper (if using) and cook until softened and lightly golden, about 5-7 minutes.\n",
      "2.  **Add Ginger-Garlic and Spices:** Add the ginger-garlic paste, turmeric powder, chili powder, cumin, and coriander. Cook for another minute, stirring constantly, until fragrant.\n",
      "3.  **Add Tomato Base:** Pour in the crushed tomatoes and tomato sauce. Bring to a simmer.\n",
      "4.  **Simmer:** Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 10-15 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld. Stir occasionally.\n",
      "5.  **Blend (Optional):** For a smoother sauce, you can use an immersion blender to blend the sauce directly in the pot. Be careful when blending hot liquids! Alternatively, let the sauce cool slightly and blend it in a regular blender, then return it to the pot.\n",
      "6.  **Add Cream and Garam Masala:** Stir in the heavy cream (or coconut cream), garam masala, and sugar (or honey). Season with salt to taste.\n",
      "7.  **Add Cooked Chicken:** Add the cooked chicken tikka to the sauce and stir to coat.\n",
      "8.  **Simmer:** Simmer for another 5-10 minutes, allowing the chicken to absorb the flavors of the sauce.\n",
      "9.  **Garnish and Serve:** Garnish with fresh cilantro leaves. Serve hot over rice, naan bread, or with other accompaniments.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Tips and Variations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Spice Level:** Adjust the amount of chili powder (or cayenne pepper) to your preferred level of spiciness.  Start with less and add more to taste.\n",
      "*   **Smoked Paprika:**  A teaspoon of smoked paprika can add a nice smoky flavor to the sauce.\n",
      "*   **Kasuri Methi (Dried Fenugreek Leaves):** Crushed kasuri methi added at the end of cooking provides a unique, slightly bitter flavor that is characteristic of many Indian dishes.  Use about 1-2 teaspoons.\n",
      "*   **Cashew Paste:** For an even richer and creamier sauce, blend about 1/4 cup of cashews (soaked in warm water for at least 30 minutes) into a paste and add it to the sauce along with the cream.\n",
      "*   **Coconut Milk:**  Use full-fat coconut milk instead of heavy cream for a dairy-free and slightly sweeter version.\n",
      "*   **Vegetables:** Add other vegetables to the sauce, such as peas, spinach, or mushrooms.\n",
      "*   **Lemon/Lime Juice:** A squeeze of fresh lemon or lime juice at the end can brighten the flavors.\n",
      "*   **Naan Bread:**  Warm naan bread is the perfect accompaniment for scooping up the delicious sauce.\n",
      "*   **Rice:** Basmati rice is the classic choice for serving with Chicken Tikka Masala.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Make Ahead:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   The chicken can be marinated up to 24 hours in advance.\n",
      "*   The sauce can be made a day or two ahead and stored in the refrigerator.  Add the cooked chicken to the sauce when you are ready to serve.\n",
      "*   Chicken Tikka Masala freezes well. Store in an airtight container for up to 2-3 months.\n",
      "\n",
      "Enjoy your homemade Chicken Tikka Masala!  Let me know if you have any questions.\n",
